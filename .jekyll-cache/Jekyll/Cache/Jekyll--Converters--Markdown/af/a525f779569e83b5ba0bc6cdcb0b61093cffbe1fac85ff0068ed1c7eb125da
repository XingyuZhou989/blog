I"Á<p>Hello.</p>

<p>This is my new blog, and the previous <a href="http://blog.csdn.net/mike190267481">CSDN blog</a> (in Chinese) will not be updated.</p>

<p>I am Xingyu Zhou (å‘¨æ˜Ÿå®‡), an assistant professor at ECE of Wayne State University, USA. This is my <a href="http://xingyuzhou.org">academic page</a>.</p>

<p>I hope that I would have time to update regularly here, either in English or Chinese.</p>

<p><strong>Less is more..</strong></p>
