Hello.

This is my new blog, and the previous [CSDN blog](http://blog.csdn.net/mike190267481) (in Chinese) will not be updated.

I am Xingyu Zhou (周星宇), a PhD student at the Ohio State University. This is my [academic page](http://xingyuzhou.org).

I hope that I would have time to update regularly here, either in English or Chinese.


**Less is more..**
